# ScholarSidekick

A collaborative tool for turning meeting transcripts into actionable, interconnected cards on a shared canvas.

## Overview

ScholarSidekick helps teams transform their weekly one-on-one meeting transcripts into organized, collaborative workspaces. The system:

1. **Extracts** meaningful cards from meeting transcripts (TL;DR, TODOs, decisions, etc.)
2. **Organizes** cards on a collaborative canvas
3. **Enables** ongoing collaboration with updates and pings between team members

## Features

- **Transcript Processing**: Upload meeting transcripts and agenda items
- **Google Docs Integration**: Import transcripts directly from Google Docs
- **Smart Extraction**: Extract different types of cards (TL;DR, TODO, Action Items, Decisions, etc.)
- **Agenda Tracking**: Identify which agenda items were covered vs. missed
- **Collaborative Canvas**: Visual workspace for organizing and linking cards
- **Card Linking**: Create hierarchies by linking cards to each other
- **Updates & Pings**: Keep collaborators informed with updates and notifications
- **Flexible Organization**: Drag-and-drop positioning, tagging, and status tracking
- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Secure Google account integration

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: Flask-SQLAlchemy with SQLite (easily switchable to PostgreSQL)
- **Serialization**: Marshmallow schemas
- **Google Integration**: Google Docs API, OAuth2

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ScholarSidekick
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Run the application:

## API Documentation

The Flask application provides a RESTful API. You can test endpoints using:
- **curl** - See examples below
- **Postman** - Import the endpoints
- **Python requests** - See `example_usage.py`

## API Endpoints

### Meetings
- `POST /api/meetings/` - Create meeting and extract cards
- `GET /api/meetings/` - List all meetings
- `GET /api/meetings/{id}` - Get meeting details
- `PUT /api/meetings/{id}` - Update meeting
- `DELETE /api/meetings/{id}` - Delete meeting
- `POST /api/meetings/{id}/reextract` - Re-extract cards with different types

### Cards
- `POST /api/cards/` - Create a new card
- `GET /api/cards/` - List cards (filterable by meeting/canvas)
- `GET /api/cards/{id}` - Get card details with updates
- `PUT /api/cards/{id}` - Update card
- `DELETE /api/cards/{id}` - Delete card
- `POST /api/cards/{id}/updates` - Add update/ping to card
- `GET /api/cards/{id}/updates` - Get card updates
- `POST /api/cards/batch-update-positions` - Update multiple card positions

### Canvas
- `POST /api/canvas/` - Create a new canvas
- `GET /api/canvas/` - List canvases
- `GET /api/canvas/{id}` - Get canvas with all cards
- `PUT /api/canvas/{id}` - Update canvas
- `DELETE /api/canvas/{id}` - Delete canvas

## Data Models

### Meeting
- Stores transcript, agenda items, and metadata
- Tracks which agenda items were not covered
- Links to cards and canvases

### Card
- Represents extracted or manually created items
- Types: TL;DR, TODO, Action Item, Decision, Question, etc.
- Supports linking (parent-child relationships)
- Tracks position on canvas
- Includes status, assignment, due dates, and tags

### Canvas
- Visual workspace for organizing cards
- Associated with a meeting
- Contains positioned cards

### Card Update
- Updates and pings on cards
- Tracks author and optional pinged user
- Maintains collaboration history

## Card Types

- **TL;DR**: High-level meeting summaries
- **TODO**: General to-do items
- **Action Item**: Specific action items with owners
- **Decision**: Decisions made during meeting
- **Question**: Open questions or clarifications needed
- **Discussion Point**: Important topics discussed
- **Follow-up**: Items requiring follow-up
- **Custom**: User-defined card types

## LLM Integration (Coming Soon)

The current implementation includes placeholder methods for:
- Card extraction from transcripts
- Agenda coverage analysis
- Transcript segment identification

These will be replaced with actual LLM API calls (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to provide intelligent extraction and analysis.

## Database Schema

The application uses SQLAlchemy ORM with the following main tables:
- `meetings` - Meeting records
- `cards` - Card items
- `canvases` - Canvas workspaces
- `card_updates` - Updates and pings

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest
```
